abstract = {With continuous growth of web applications around the globe, it is a challenge to find the suitable information needed for the user in a limited time.Number of handheld mobile devices is increasing and most of the business revolves around the correct search of the data. Without a proper recommender system it is very difficult to get required information from the web applications. Web applications use recommender systems to provide suitable data to users based on their choices and interests. For different kinds of needs different types of recommender systems have been proposed. Two most basic types of recommender systems are collaborative filtering recommender system and content based recommender system. Sometimes these two recommender systems are combined to increase the efficiency of a recommender system The generated new recommender system is known as hybrid recommender system.

The purpose of this paper is to help readers understand the basics of recommender systems. This paper identifies key areas of research openly available for new researchers. After reading this paper new researchers can understand basic problems of recommender systems which need improvement and hence they can make those problems their area of research.}

abstract = {With the growing volume of online information, recommender systems have been an effective strategy to overcome information overload. The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given their widespread adoption in many web applications, along with their potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice. In recent years, deep learning has garnered considerable interest in many research fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, owing not only to stellar performance but also to the attractive property of learning feature representations from scratch. The influence of deep learning is also pervasive, recently demonstrating its effectiveness when applied to information retrieval and recommender systems research. The field of deep learning in recommender system is flourishing. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on deep learning-based recommender systems. More concretely, we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning-based recommendation models, along with a comprehensive summary of the state of the art. Finally, we expand on current trends and provide new perspectives pertaining to this new and exciting development of the field.},

An important catalyst in this regard is the ease with which the Web enables users to provide feedback about their likes or dislikes. For example, consider a scenario of a content provider such as Netflix. In such cases, users are able to easily provide feedback with a simple click of a mouse. A typical methodology to provide feedback is in the form of ratings, in which users select numerical values from a specific evaluation system (e.g., five-star rating system) that specify their likes and dislikes of various items.",

abstract="Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendater system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommender systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.",

This principle assumes the existence of a hierarchy of information objects, similar to the hierarchy, which reflects different levels of organization of matter (mechanical, chemical, biological, social). The construction of a hierarchy of information objects - information processing systems - allows us to interpret in the same way the essence of both artificial intelligence and the intelligence that a human being is endowed with. These are information processing systems referring to the highest levels of the specified hierarchy.},

abstract = {Matrix Factorization is a successful approach for generating an effective recommender system. However, most existing matrix factorization methods suffer from the sparsity and cold-start issues of the user-item matrix as the primary information source of recommender systems. Besides, they are not much scalable to apply to large real-world applications. A main idea to overcome the cold-start and sparsity issues is to use additional information sources such as user/item profiles or user reviews on items. In this paper, a novel Attention-based Deep Learning Recommender System, so-called ADLRS, is proposed to employ the information sources in the matrix factorization method framework. The proposed method uses a language model to represent contextual information such that important features are effectively embedded. Moreover, a deep autoencoder reduces the dimensionality of item vectors embedded by the language model. Then, these vectors are used as regularization terms in the matrix factorization framework to form an objective function. Then, an iterative algorithm is designed to solve the objective function and provide a method prediction of unknown rating values. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art ones in most cases. Moreover, the improvement rate for sparse datasets and cold items proves that the proposed method effectively deals with sparsity, cold start and scalability problems.}

abstract = {Big deep neural network (DNN) models trained on large amounts of data have recently achieved the best accuracy on hard tasks, such as image and speech recognition. Training these DNNs using a cluster of commodity machines is a promising approach since training is time consuming and compute-intensive. To enable training of extremely large DNNs, models are partitioned across machines. To expedite training on very large data sets, multiple model replicas are trained in parallel on different subsets of the training examples with a global parameter server maintaining shared weights across these replicas. The correct choice for model and data partitioning and overall system provisioning is highly dependent on the DNN and distributed system hardware characteristics. These decisions currently require significant domain expertise and time consuming empirical state space exploration.This paper develops performance models that quantify the impact of these partitioning and provisioning decisions on overall distributed system performance and scalability. Also, we use these performance models to build a scalability optimizer that efficiently determines the optimal system configuration that minimizes DNN training time. We evaluate our performance models and scalability optimizer using a state-of-the-art distributed DNN training framework on two benchmark applications. The results show our performance models estimate DNN training time with high estimation accuracy and our scalability optimizer correctly chooses the best configurations, minimizing the training time of distributed DNNs.},
