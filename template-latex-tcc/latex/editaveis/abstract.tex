\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  Recommender systems are software algorithms designed to analyze user's behavior and past preferences, with 
  the goal of suggesting items that may be of interest to them. These systems are widely used on various platforms, 
  such as streaming services, online stores, social networks, and other applications, to personalize the user 
  experience and improve satisfaction by offering relevant and personalized recommendations. However, we still have a 
  lot to learn about these systems and how they could generate more satiasfaction for their users. This work aims to 
  create a Recommendation System with the application of Artificial Intelligence and evaluate the user satisfaction after 
  using the System. To do this, a model trained by Collaborative Filters will be created, and then this model will be used 
  to train a Convolutional Neural Network model in order to improve the recommendations. In the end, metrics such as 
  Precision will be used; Recall; Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error, to evaluate the resulting model, and this 
  model will be applied to an API so that users can use and evaluate the Recommender System.
